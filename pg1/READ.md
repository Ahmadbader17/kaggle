This repo consists of my notebooks and models submitted to the following kaggle competition:

Binary Classification with a Bank Churn Dataset

Overview
Welcome to the 2024 Kaggle Playground Series! Happy New Year! This is the 1st episode of Season 4. We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting an approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.

Your Goal: For this Episode of the Series, your task is to predict whether a customer continues with their account or closes it (e.g., churns). Good luck!
Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

Submission File
For each id in the test set, you must predict the probability for the target variable Exited. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

id,Exited
165034,0.9
165035,0.1
165036,0.5
etc.
